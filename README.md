# Fashion MNIST Classification with Neural Networks

## Overview
This repository contains a notebook that demonstrates image classification using the Fashion MNIST dataset. 
The project includes data exploration, training of multiple neural network models, and comparison of their performance.

## Project Structure
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Preprocessing and understanding the dataset, including visualizations of class distributions and sample images.
2. **Experiment 1 - Custom Model:** Training and evaluating a custom neural network model.
3. **Experiment 2 - Model Comparison:** Training and comparing three different models.
4. **Model Comparison:** Comparing performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for all models.
5. **Final Evaluation:** Rerunning the best-performing model on the training set and reporting detailed metrics.

## Results
The notebook calculates and compares model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
